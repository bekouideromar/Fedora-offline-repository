## Introduction

This guide is designed for users who want to set up a local offline repository for **Fedora Linux**. It is particularly useful for environments where internet access is limited or unavailable. By creating an offline repository, you can ensure that your system can still install and update packages without needing a direct connection to external repositories.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following:
- A **Fedora-based** system.
- Root (administrator) access to the system.
- A USB drive or local directory to store downloaded packages.
- The `createrepo` package installed.
